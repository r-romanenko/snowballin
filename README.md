# Snowballin'
In Snowballin’, guide a small snowball down a hill as it picks up speed and mass. Dodge boulders and other treacherous obstacles as you grow into an unstoppable force of nature. The bigger and faster you get, the more devastation you’ll cause as you slam into a new object at the end of every level.
